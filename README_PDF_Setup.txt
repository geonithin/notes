PDF SETUP GUIDE FOR GEO'S NOTES
=====================================

To make your website work with your PDF files, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Copy your PDF files to this folder
------------------------------------------
Place your three PDF files in the same folder as note.html:
Current location: e:\notes\

Your folder should look like this:
e:\notes\
├── note.html
├── document1.pdf (Career Essentials in System Administration)
├── document2.pdf (Career Essentials in Cybersecurity)
├── document3.pdf (Operating System Basics)
└── README_PDF_Setup.txt (this file)


STEP 2: Rename your PDF files
-----------------------------
Rename your PDF files to match these exact names:

1. Your "Career Essentials in System Administration" PDF → rename to: document1.pdf
2. Your "Career Essentials in Cybersecurity" PDF → rename to: document2.pdf  
3. Your "Operating System Basics" PDF → rename to: document3.pdf


HOW TO RENAME FILES IN WINDOWS:
-------------------------------
1. Right-click on the PDF file
2. Select "Rename" from the menu
3. Type the new name (document1.pdf, document2.pdf, or document3.pdf)
4. Press Enter


STEP 3: Test your website
------------------------
1. Double-click on note.html to open it in your browser
2. Click on each PDF card to make sure the files open correctly


ALTERNATIVE: If you want to keep your original PDF names
-------------------------------------------------------
If you prefer to keep your original PDF filenames, just tell me what they are called, 
and I can update the HTML code to use your actual filenames instead.

For example, if your files are named:
- "System Admin Course Certificate.pdf"
- "Cybersecurity Training.pdf" 
- "Cisco OS Basics.pdf"

I can modify the HTML links to use these names.


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- Make sure PDF files are in the exact same folder as note.html
- Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure PDF files are not corrupted
- Try opening the website in different browsers if needed
